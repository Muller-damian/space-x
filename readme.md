breakdown of website
in building of this landing page broke it down into
three parts ,navbar body and footer
then i would start with building the navbar which consits of 2 components 
the left and the right navbars
once im done handling the navbar 
i would go into the body section which comprises of 5 sections in which theres a background image and a div that will contain some writings of each section
then after i am done doing that ,the next thing would be to do the footer 
the footer itself is divided into two sections
